# ZeroSync Client

Linux, Mac and Windows file sync client


## About zeroclient

The clients primary task is to watch the file system for changes. We are using the QtFileSystemWatcher class from the Qt-Framework to accomplish this task. In case of an updated file the client will inform others about the change and provide the data once another peer requests it.
